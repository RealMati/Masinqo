### Description
Masinko is a web-based music-sharing platform where artists can upload their works to a public platform where tracks are downloaded and rated by a general audience. The platform is motivated by the current musical atmosphere in which big streaming platforms continue to rise while pushing the most established musicians and bands without making special provisions for underground/local scenes. Music is a big part of culture, and we believe that the general trend toward Western
ideologies should not belittle the identity of any nation. This platform aims to uplift the discoverability of independent Ethiopian artists so that they may openly release their works to a platform that provides an even playing field regardless of their popularity or past achievements.
